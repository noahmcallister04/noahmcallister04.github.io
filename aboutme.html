  <h1>Basic Information About Myself:</h1>
    
  <h2>Background:</h2>
  <p>
    I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/vt/data=3CdSwpzA4yn7jto2yfa6tRLIwS3WYJdGvEmB0OxUlFkbVrISAYuXTRo0kZcEFpLDluOyS2vtS1gtW4EapToRT0mwtXOfFzE2BLmUKuWna9Q67gTlpymyFppHJvuAec5dHzXTQ4wPd1gnfvDsSb9YyVm-bKwehmSqOlYqIuZ7jP12OhHmImKmmZS5WGprX15YbqJEYiE_bHuweboz6zWiidLt1yOB3HkI_OiEtymPJOG4TC_PWC0LxxS5">St. Charles County</a>, which is about an hour from St. Louis.
    I attended Fort Zumwalt West Highschool and took a basic web design and intro to python class.
    I've always known I wanted to do something with computers and technology and I enjoy learning about
    coding and software engineering in my college classes.
  </p>
    
  <h2>Interests:</h2>
  <p>
    As stated before I have always been interested in computers and technology. In middle
    school I would experiment in graphic design and video editing and often collaborate with very small
    youtube channels to provide them with artwork. Since then I have lost interest in the media side and would like to persue software engineering.
  </p>
    
  <h2>Where I'm at now:</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently a student at <a href="https://missouri.edu/">Missouri University</a> and my major as of now is Information technology. In my college classes I have started learning and improving my skills in three programming languages.
  </p>
    
  <ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>
    I plan on continuing this path as my major and to hopefully become a software engineer after college.

<p>My car is not anything special, but it was exactly the one I wanted since I was 13. The car I drive 
is a <em>*Infiniti G37</em>. My interest in this car stems from my interest in the Nissan 370z. The G37 has the same engine as the 370z but it has more luxury, daily features that you wouldn&#39;t find in a 370z including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sunroof</li>
<li>Heated Seats</li>
<li>Powered Seats and powered telescoping steering wheel</li>
<li><p>Back seats</li>
</ul>

<p>My car is completely stock at the moment, aside from exhaust, but I plan on using this image as inspiration for the future of the car:</p>
